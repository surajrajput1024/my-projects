/**
 * Strategy Design Pattern: Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows us to define a family of
 * algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm, and make them interchangeable. The Strategy pattern lets the algorithm vary
 * independently from the clients that use it.
 * 
 * Real world example:
 * 1. Sorting algorithms: Sorting algorithms are a real world example of Strategy Design Pattern. In sorting algorithms,
 *    there are many algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, etc. Each sorting
 *    algorithm is encapsulated in a separate class and the client can choose the algorithm that they want to use.
 * 
 * 2. Payment methods: Payment methods are another real world example of Strategy Design Pattern. In payment methods, there
 *   are many payment methods like credit card, debit card, net banking, UPI, etc. Each payment method is encapsulated in
 *  a separate class and the client can choose the payment method that they want to use.
 * 
 * 3. Travel booking: Travel booking is another real world example of Strategy Design Pattern. In travel booking, there are
 *   many travel booking websites like MakeMyTrip, Goibibo, Yatra, etc. Each travel booking website has different
 * algorithms for booking flights, hotels, buses, etc. The client can choose the travel booking website that they want to
 * use.
